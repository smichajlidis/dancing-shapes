# SFML Geometry Manipulation Program

Delve into my inaugural SFML programming experiment—a modest showcase of my budding coding skills. This project serves as a starting point, an exploration into the capabilities of SFML, and a testament to my initial foray into this library. Experiment with geometric shapes, adjust sizes, and explore rotations—it's a simple yet meaningful introduction to my journey with SFML. Join me in this humble presentation of my first steps in coding with SFML.

## Features

- Press 'c' to switch to a circle.
- Press 'r' to switch to a rectangle.
- Press 'p' to switch to a point (dot).
- Press 't' to switch to a triangle.

### Manipulating Active Figure:

- Use arrow keys to move the active figure around the screen.
- Press 'i' to increase the size of the active figure.
- Press 's' to decrease the size of the active figure.
- Press 'q' to rotate the active figure counterclockwise.
- Press 'e' to rotate the active figure clockwise.
- Press 'd' to move the active figure one layer down.
- Press 'u' to move the active figure one layer up.

## How to Build and Run

1. **Requirements**: Ensure you have SFML installed. You can download it [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php).

2. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/smichajlidis/dancing-shapes.git
    cd dancing-shapes
    ```

3. **Build using CMake:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    ```

4. **Compile the project:**
    ```bash
    make
    ```

5. **Run the simulator:**
    ```bash
    ./dancing-shapes
    ```
